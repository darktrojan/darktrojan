### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior software engineer at [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/). This takes up most of my time and doesn't leave a lot for the projects you'll find here, which are mostly add-ons for Thunderbird and/or [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/), and other bits and pieces I've created over the years.
